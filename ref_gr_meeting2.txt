Reference group meeting 2: 12.04.18 

Course has been taught for many years. In spite of this, Kristian discovered 
that book wasn't particularly complete in terms of the applications of fourier 
analysis. Therefore many of the topics covered were picked from other books.

Based on this, the book should probably be replaced for next year.

In terms of material, fourier analysis itself could have been elaborated more.

The exercises worked out all right, but consider adding a project for next year.
For it to count towards the final grade the course description must be updated.
A project would be a nice way for students from different backgrounds to elaborate
on material relevant to them, and their further development.

Q&A session friday 18th of may?
