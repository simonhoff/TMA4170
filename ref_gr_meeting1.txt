Reference group meeting TMA4170, 23.01.2018

Lecturer finds it a pity that so many people seem to have
dropped out of the course already.

Students find the course material to be manageble so far,
and while the lecturer isn't convinced about the textbook,
the students think it is all right.
Lecturer will post information about another textbook which
covers the material of the course well.Will also continue to 
cover material not covered in the book through assignments.

Presenting the plan for each lecture is very helpful, but
it would be nice if it is clarified whenever a topic will be
introduced through an example. Lecturer would like to clarify
that interruptions are appriciated if anything is unclear or
difficult to understand.
